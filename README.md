# Video-games-sales

## Goal
This project belongs to descriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics is aimed at analyzing past data to identify patterns and trends, and to answer questions like “What happened?” In the “Video Games Sales” project, I was asked to work as a data analyst for a video game retailer in Japan. The challenge is to develop a model that can predict game sales in Japan based on sales data in North America and Europe, as well as other attributes such as game title, platform, genre, and publisher.

This project can be classified as a predictive analytics or machine learning project. The main goal of such a project is to predict future values ​​(in this case, sales in Japan) based on historical data and attributes (sales in other regions, platforms, genres, and publishers).

## Data overview:

This dataset contains a list of video games that have sold more than 100,000 copies. It was generated by copying vgchartz.com.

Fields include

Rating - Rating of total sales

Name - the name of the game

Platform – the game release platform (e.g. PC, PS4, etc.)

Year - the year the game was released

Genre - Genre of the game

Publisher - Publisher of the game

NA_Sales - North American Sales (millions)

EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)

JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (millions)

Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)

Global_Sales – the total volume of sales worldwide.

The data scraping script is available at [https://github.com/GregorUT/vgchartzScrape.](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/external-link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGregorUT%2FvgchartzScrape)  It is based on BeautifulSoup using Python. There are 16,598 entries. 2 records were removed due to incomplete information.

## Results: 
The sales_summary report contains information about each video game genre, including total sales and average sales, sorted by total sales.

This set of commands provides general information about the data structure in DataFrame sales, including data types and gaps, and allows you to view the first 100 records and list all columns in the table. This is useful for an initial overview and understanding of the data structure before performing more in-depth analysis.

This analysis provides an initial understanding of the data structure and helps verify that the data was loaded correctly from the file.

## Conclusions: 
We can see which video game genres are the most successful in global sales, which can be useful for strategic planning in the field of video game development and marketing. Together, these three analyzes provide a complete picture of the structure and main characteristics of the data, as well as provide important statistical conclusions about sales of video games by genre.
